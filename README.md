I have included the CSVs already populated in along with the Notebook, in the case that something occurs where the webscraping ceases to work correctly,
you can stil run the code in the Data Analysis section.

Instructions:

Uncomment these commands in the first code cell, to make sure you have these modules installed.
#installs of modules
#!pip install beautifulsoup4
#!pip install matplotlib
#!pip show pylot
#!pip install wordcloud
#!pip install requests
#!pip install selenium
#!pip install IPython
#!pip install numpy

Run each cell in order.
For the data analysis you are required to input an actor/actress' name. You must type their name exactly as it appears in the CSV (including capitals) or else
the program will not find the actor in question.
If you hover the mouse next to the output cell, you can expand or shrink the cell size. Make sure when you initally run a code cell, to expand the output so
you can see the full result.

CAUTION!
The code cell for "STORING FOR ALL OTHER TABLES IN ONE FUNCTION" takes at least an hour to execute so have it run while you do something else. 
Or you can return to it at the end.
